# DLTM_demo
A simple implementation of paper "A Dual-Scale Lead-Separated Transformer with Lead Orthogonal Attention and Meta-Information for ECG Classification". 

In order to reproduce the results in the paper, you need to download the PTB-XL dataset at https://physionet.org/content/ptb-xl/1.0.1/, preprocess the data to 100Hz numpy array "raw100_npy" following the paper "Deep Learning for ECG Analysis: Benchmarks and Insights from PTB-XL"( or download preprocessed .npy file from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1PbpaC1oMjBqMaI4u0UZjjQ with extraction code "ki7g" ) , and then run the main ipynb file after modifying the task and database path.

## Requirements:
##### pytorch==1.7.1
##### numpy==1.18.5
##### pandas==1.4.1
